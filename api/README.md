# JS-Project-9
 REST API Project

This is the first half of a full-stack application.  The files contained create a database, containing User and Course Models, and utilizes basic authentication, and CRUD opperations.  

I am striving for the 'Exceeds Expectations' Grade.  If my project does not meet the 
Exceeds Expectations Requirements, I would like my project to be rejected.
