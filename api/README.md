REST API Project
Express API

This is the first half of a full-stack application.  The files contained create a database, containing User and Course Models, and utilizes basic authentication, and CRUD opperations.  

You can use npm start or nodemon to run the program.  The API runs on PORT 5000, while the 
client runs on PORT 3000.  Once both are running, you can view the program at http://localhost:3000 in your local browser.
