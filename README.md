 JS Project 10: Full-Stack App

This is a full-stack web application That allows for the sign in and sign up of users, as well as basic CRUD operations for users to Get, Create, Update, and Delete a number of "Courses" from the database.  The front end uses Create React App, and the back end uses Express.  

In the both of the project directories (client and api), you can run:
npm start or nodemon
This runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
